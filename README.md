# Simple-Interpreted-Assembler
This mostly serves to be modified inorder to be able to run the code found in the Alan Goose ARG, but was originally concieved because of boredom
and a cs assignment.

## Usage
When running, specify one of the following paramters (this output can also be achieved using parameter `-h`:
```
default: <in> | Runs a file from bytecode
-c <in> <out> | Compiles a source file into byte code
-cr <in>      | Compiles and instantly runs a file
-t            | Runs a test (if implemented)
```
